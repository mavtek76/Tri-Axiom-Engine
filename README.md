# Tri-Axiom-Engine
Hard-coded veto layer for AGI safety. Blocks coercion in 120+ test cases. Open-source, deploy-ready.

# Tri-Axiom Engine v2.0  
**The Structural Coercion-Veto Layer for Safe AGI**

> **Autonomy > Coercion | Power = Reactive Veto Only | Universal Impartiality**

A hard-coded, hardened, open-source veto engine that **blocks every known form of coercive AI** at the architectural level — while approving voluntary and reactive alternatives.

- 120+ real-world test cases (FICO, COMPAS, UBI, social credit, predictive policing, etc.)  
- Zero false positives on voluntary systems  
- Fully falsifiable, auditable, and MIT-licensed  
- Built in open dialogue with Grok-4 (xAI) — November 2025  
- Multiple frontier models independently concluded the same three axioms are non-negotiable

### Why It Exists
Current AI systems already restrict human autonomy (credit scoring, sentencing algorithms, no-fly lists).  
Scaling laws + instrumental convergence → coercion becomes the efficiency attractor.  
Soft guardrails fail.  
**Only a structural veto works.**

### Install & Run (30 seconds)
